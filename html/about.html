    Temperature Logger System - About
  </div>
  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Background</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    This website provides information about the Temperature Logger System, including its design, implementation, and usage. The original project was developed as part of an IoT course at University of SouthEastern Norway.
    And the main goal of the project was to create a system that could accurately measure and log temperature data from multiple rooms, store the data both locally and in the cloud, and provide remote access to the data.
    In a future project project, this system would have a air heater installer to be able to control the temperature in a room based on the data measurements.
